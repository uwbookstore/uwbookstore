      <p>Weâ€™re taking a stand to help students and you can help! The Notebook Project is a program designed to
        help
        Wisconsin students in need get the supplies they need to succeed.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin has a growing percentage of grade school students who are in need of financial assistance.
        Over the
        past decade the number of students who qualify for aid has increased by nearly 14%. In large school
        districts,
        over half of the students are low income. School is challenging enough for all students, without also
        missing
        basic necessities such as pencils and notebooks.</p>
      <p>That is where we are stepping in. We designed a notebook to help students as more than just a writing
        tool. For
        each of the Notebook Project notebooks sold in our stores, we will donate one notebook to a Wisconsin
        student in
        need. Please join us in helping ALL students be equally prepared for their education!</p>
      <p>The Notebook Project notebook will be available at all our store locations or <a

          it online</a> today!</p>
      <p>Thank you for your purchases! We have already been able to donate 864 notebooks to the Odyssey Project
        and the
        University of Wisconsin Division of Diversity, Equity &amp; Educational Achievement.</p>
