            Testing conducted by Apple in January 2025 using preproduction 13-inch MacBook Air systems with Apple M4,
            10-core CPU,
            and 8-core GPU, and preproduction 15-inch MacBook Air systems with Apple M4, 10-core CPU, and 10-core GPU,
            all
            configured with 16GB of RAM and 256GB SSD. Wireless web battery life tested by browsing 25 popular websites
            while
            connected to Wi-Fi. Video streaming battery life tested with 1080p content in Safari while connected to
            Wi-Fi. All
            systems tested with display brightness set to eight clicks from bottom and keyboard backlight off.

            Case
            paired with preproduction iPhone 17 Pro units, all with prerelease software. The playlist consisted of 358
            unique audio
            tracks purchased from the iTunes Store (256-Kbps AAC encoding). Volume was set to 50% and Active Noise
            Cancellation was

            of full
            AirPods Pro battery discharge while playing audio until the first AirPod Pro stopped playback. Battery life
            depends on
            device settings, environment, usage, and many other factors.

            Emergency SOS requires a cellular connection or Wi-Fi calling with an internet connection from your Apple
            Watch or
            nearby iPhone. You can use cellular models of Apple Watch to make an emergency call in many locations,
            provided that
            cellular service is available. Some cellular networks may not accept an emergency call from your Apple Watch
            if your
            Apple Watch isn&rsquo;t activated, if it isn&rsquo;t compatible with or configured to operate on a
            particular cellular
            network, if
            isn&rsquo;t set up for cellular service, or if the cellular network does not support emergency calling over
            IMS.

          unexpected and unintentional events. Replacement equipment that Apple provides as part of the repair or
          replacement
          service may contain new or previously used genuine Apple parts that have been tested and pass Apple functional
          requirements. There are no service fees for mechanical failures. Each incident of accidental damage protection
          is
          subject to a service fee plus applicable tax. For complete details, see the AppleCare+ Terms and Conditions
          applicable

          For Apple Watch, the band that is covered for accidental damage and defects in material or workmanship under
          your plan
          is the band that came in the same box as the covered Apple Watch. Apple Watch Herm&egrave;s bands, other than
          the Herm&egrave;s Sport
          band supplied in the same box as the covered Apple Watch, are not covered. Any replacement band will be an
          Apple-branded
          band in a style, material, and color that is subject to Apple&rsquo;s discretion.

          Local telephone fees may apply. Telephone numbers and hours of operation may vary and are subject to change.
          Express Replacement Service (&ldquo;ERS&rdquo;) is subject to availability, capability, and local law at the
          time you seek service.
          ERS for Hardware Coverage for Accidental Damage to the Covered Equipment (excluding Included Accessories) is
          always
          subject to the Other Accidental Damage service fee and not the Screen-Only or Back Glass-Only service fees. If
          your
          device is replaced with Express Replacement Service, the original product becomes Apple&rsquo;s property. The
          replacement
          product is your property and becomes the Covered Equipment. You are responsible for backing up all software
          programs,
          data, and passwords residing on your original device.

          Service coverage is provided under the Terms and Conditions of your AppleCare plan applicable to your state.
          Service
          coverage outside the country of purchase of your AppleCare plan is not guaranteed. The availability and type
          of repair
          or replacement may vary depending on your device model, applicable local laws, and the capabilities of Apple
          Authorized
          Service Providers in the location where service is requested. Some service options may not be available in all
          areas. If
          service is available and repair is possible, Apple may, at its discretion, offer to repair or replace your
          device using
          locally sourced models or parts that meet local standards and regulations, which may differ from the original
          device in
          terms of color and/or specifications. For details, please review the Terms and Conditions applicable to your
          region at

          The service fee for accidental damage is $69 for Apple Watch or $79 for Apple Watch Ultra and Apple Watch
          Herm&egrave;s.
          Separate service charges apply to each repair or replacement performed. May require verification of your
          device, inspection, and a diagnostic.
