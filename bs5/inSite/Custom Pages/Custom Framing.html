      <p>Since May 1, 2009, The University Book Store, at its 711
        State Street location, has offered full service, in-house, custom framing. Staffed
        by John Sheean (B.S., M.A., and M.F.A. in studio art) with over 35 years of
        professional framing experience he can offer expert consultation on all framing
        projects. His framing department client base includes the Wisconsin Historical
        Society, the Wisconsin Historical Foundation, dozens of university departments,
        faculty, and students. He also provides services for many campus and local
        businesses, along with many local professional artists.</p>

        in my private collection in the hands of John Sheean at the University Bookstore
        Custom Framing shop. As a contemporary international artist, I value professional
        relationships. You&rsquo;ll get nothing less working with John Sheean. He&rsquo;s courteous,

        professional advice regarding the most challenging of projects. He&rsquo;s a true problem
        solver and his attention to detail is remarkable. When working with John I know my
        artworks will be taken care of and framed with archival techniques and materials
        held to museum standards with consideration given to art world trends. I&rsquo;m proud to
        have everything from my drawings to family pictures framed at the

        needs at the College of Letters and Science Dean&rsquo;s Suite. He was exceptionally
        thoughtful regarding the selection of materials given the composition and setting of the
        piece, and the fantastic customer service didn&rsquo;t end there. John was also great when it
        came to delivery and placement of the framed art which resulted in a product that can be
        appreciated by the people who visit our space."<cite>
