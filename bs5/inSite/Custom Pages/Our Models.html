  <p>We have chosen to represent our Badger gear in the best way possible, on real Badger fans! All our clothing models
    are members of our community, either customers, employees, or current students at the University of
    Wisconsin-Madison.</p>

      <h2 class="heading__small">Model of the Month</h2>
      <p>Our biggest modeling initiative is the Model of the Month program. We began the program in 2012, offering an
        opportunity for the students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to represent their campus. Twelve students,
        one for every month, are chosen yearly through an application and interview process. These are the very models
        you see throughout our website, store, and social media!</p>
      <p>The student models are enthusiastic about the University and the Book Store, and we are happy to provide this
        fun experience. Each model brings their unique personality to this campus, our clothing, and the community. The
        shoot will consist of photos in the studio as well as around campus in our merchandise. All models will be
        responsible for posting two of their pictures from the shoot on their personal Instagram account. Click to view
