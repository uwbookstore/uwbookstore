      question: 'When is the best time to purchase a computer or iPad',
      answer: `<p>The best deals usually run June–September, often with extra discounts or free items in addition to our everyday academic discounts.</p>
      <p>Many students buy their computers in-store during SOAR, so we can help them choose the right one with back-to-school promotions, and help get it setup.</p>
      <p>You can also get all the same discounts at uwbookstore.com or even wait until move-in, as we keep the most popular devices in stock year-round.</p>

      question: 'How do I know what kind of computer I need',
      answer: `<p>Recommendations depend mostly on the software used in your major.</p>
      <p>The MacBook Air is our most popular computer and works well for most students, but some majors need more power or require Windows-only software. Class needs can also change each semester, and software changes over time, so perfect compatibility can&rsquo;t be guaranteed.</p>
      <p>Computer labs are available around campus and UW-Madison offers loaner computers through DoIT and some library locations, so there are options to deal with occasional compatibility issues.</p>
      <p class="mb-0">Common Recommendations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Engineering/Architecture: A newer, powerful Windows computer with a dedicated graphics card for CAD software, modeling/3D rendering, solving complex equations, etc.</li>
        <li>Business: Some classes use Windows-only Excel add-ons or analysis software, so the School of Business recommends a mid-tier Windows computer. You don’t need a graphics card or the extra power like an Engineering computer though. Some students will use a Mac IF they are taking mostly marketing or communications-type classes that don't require Windows software, though the School of Business still recommends Windows.</li>
        <li>Most other majors: A recent, reliable Apple or Windows computer that handles basic software and multitasking is typically sufficient.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>UW-Madison doesn't support or recommend Chromebooks for any students due to limited power and compatibility issues.</p>
      <p>If unsure, ask us or your advisor.</p>

      question: 'How much memory and storage should my computer have',
      answer: `<p>RAM (Memory) partially determines how fast your computer works... so does the type of chip, processor, and graphics.</p>
      <p>SSD (Storage) is how much file space your computer has for saving things.</p>
      <p>Most students do well with 16 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD storage.</p>
      <p>More intensive majors (computer science, engineering, architecture, digital art, media-editing) may need more RAM, more storage, and/or a more powerful chip, processor, and graphics.</p>
      <p>RAM and SSDs vary in speed, so performance can still differ even when capacities match- better computers often use better quality, faster RAM and SSDs.</p>

      question: 'Do I need a computer and an iPad/tablet',
      answer: `<p>You should choose an Apple or Windows computer first, based on your major. UW-Madison doesn't recommend Chromebooks at all, and suggests a computer as your first priority for better software compatibility than an iPad/tablet.</p>
      <p>Many students use an iPad/tablet as a more portable secondary device for note-taking on slides and diagrams. iPads get more popular every year, with many students picking one up during SOAR and others getting one during the first couple weeks of class after seeing them used by friends and classmates. We typically stock the most popular iPads year-round, and usually the best deals last through September.</p>

      question: 'Do I need to buy software before class',
      answer: `<p>Most classes only really need internet and email access, plus basic software such as:<br>
      CANVAS: which you have free access to online with your NetID.<br>
      OFFICE 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook): which is free for students to use online and to download. Some professors are also fine with the Apple or Google versions of the Microsoft Office apps instead.<br>
      ANTIVIRUS: usually a basic free version is sufficient...</p>
      <p>Most Windows users will use the built-in Windows Defender, or a free download such as BitDefender.</p>
      <p>Most Apple users will use a free download such as Avast or BitDefender, or one of the others UW-Madison recommends at <a href="https://kb.wisc.edu/63977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">kb.wisc.edu/63977</a></p>
      <p>Typically, any other software you need is only available AFTER registering for a class that requires it, usually as a free or discounted download from the UW-Madison Campus Software Library online.</p>
      <p>If you buy a computer from us, we can help you setup Office 365 and antivirus in-store for free.</p>

      question: 'Is there a handling charge on my tech order? Why or why not',
      answer: `<p>If you are doing pickup in-store, all shipping and handling charges will be removed after you place your order- it will look like you are going to pay for handling, but you don’t actually get charged for anything until we approve your specific order.</p>
      <p>The handling charges on tech items are for shipping insurance and sign on delivery needs, to cover any potential damage or loss during shipping.</p>

    {
      question: 'How long does it take to process a tech order',
      answer: `<p>Most tech items are stocked in-store, so orders are usually processed the next day.<p>
      <p>Some of the less common items list online that they take 1-3 extra business days if coming from another warehouse.</p>
      <p>Most shipments take just 1-3 business days (5-7 if farther away).</p>
      <p>In-store pickup is usually ready 1-2 days after ordering... you will receive text and/or email notification when a pickup order is available.</p>
      <p>You are charged only after your order is filled and prepared for pickup or shipping.</p>

    {
      question:
        'Why isn&rsquo;t this sale or my promo code working on my tech order',
      answer: `<p>Most tech discounts are already applied automatically and don&apos;t need a promo code. Discounted tech items are marked with a &ldquo;SALE&rdquo; tag and should say clearly in the item description what the promo or discount is. Tech promotions that include a free or discounted extra item with purchase may not show the discount on the extra item until the last step of the checkout process.</p>
      <p>General Book Store promotions usually don&rsquo;t apply to tech items or tech shipping &amp; handling charges.</p>
      <p>You are charged only after your order is filled and prepared for pickup or shipping, at which point discounts or promos will be confirmed, corrected, or removed if not applicable.</p>
