  <h1 class="heading__line">Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p> At The University Book Store we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect
    from
    you to process orders and to ensure that we provide you with the best services to suit your needs.</p>
  <h4>What We Collect and Where Do We Collect It</h4>
  <p>All users of the site are free to explore most of the site without providing any personal information to The
    University Book Store. In other areas of the site you may be asked to provide the following information:</p>
  <ol class="alpha">
    <li>If you place an order with your credit card, we gather contact and address information; credit card type,
      number
      and expiration date; and e-mail address.</li>
    <li>If you contact us via e-mail or Feedback form on our site we collect your e-mail address so that we may
      respond
      to your e-mail.</li>
    <li>If you enter your name in any of our raffles, your e-mail address will be emailed once with an invitation to
      subscribe to our periodic e-mail newsletters and special offers.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>As with most web sites, we monitor where users of the site travel throughout the site so that we can develop a
    better understanding of the areas of greatest interest.</p>

  <h4>How The University Book Store Uses This Information</h4>
  <ol class="alpha">
    <li><strong>Navigational</strong><br>
      Our system automatically gathers information about the areas visited by users. To do this, The University Book
      Store logs IP addresses (in other words, the location of your computer on the Internet) for system
      administration,
      troubleshooting and to examine overall traffic trends. (For example, IP addresses help us determine the number
      of
      people coming from various gateways, such as AOL.) We do not use any of this navigational data on an
      individual
      basis. Nor do we share any of this data with outside companies. We do use navigational information in the
      aggregate to understand how our users travel around the site as a group to use the services that we offer. We
      collect that information so that The University Book Store can constantly improve the site. We may also share
      this
      statistical information with our partners or other outside companies, but in doing so, we do not disclose
      individual names or personal navigational information.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal</strong><br>
      When you place an order with The University Book Store, we will ask you for some information, such as name,
      address and email. When you go to buy an item, additional information, such as your preferred means of payment
      and
      your shipping address, will be required.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We might, from time to time, use the information provided to send you alerts about upcoming events and
    promotions
    and to create general customer profiles. You can — at any time — "opt-out" of receiving such communication by
    unsubscribing to the email.</p>
  <h4>We Do Not Sell, Trade or Disclose Your Personal Information</h4>
  <p>The University Book Store does not disclose, share, sell or trade any personal or individual information that
    it
    collects to third parties other than in the course of completing a transaction that you have requested or in
    response to an investigation involving legal matters. While we may provide information regarding site usage to
    third
    parties, such as traffic reports and sale information, this information will not include any of your personal
    information.</p>
  <p><strong>The University Book Store Protects Customer Information</strong><br>
    The University Book Store uses a secure server. The servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced
    encryption
    technology that safeguards your personal information and guarantees privacy. The University Book Store check-out
    process is certified secure by VeriSign.</p>
  <p><strong>Links</strong><br>
    We keep track of links that appear on our site that you may use to exit our site, but we do not keep track of
    where
    you go on the World Wide Web. The Web sites you visit may have their own privacy policies or no policy at all.
    We
    encourage you to review the privacy policies of Web sites before providing them with any of your personal
    information. The University Book Store is not responsible for the privacy policies of those sites nor for any
    cookies those sites may deposit on your hard drive.</p>
  <p><strong>About Children</strong><br>
    The University Book Store does not target children nor does The University Book Store expect to attract children
    to
    its site. Because we are not a children's site, we do not provide most of the privacy measures that are so
    important
    for their protection on the Internet. Because of this, we ask that minors do not submit information to The
    University Book Store without the express consent and participation of a parent or guardian.</p>
  <p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong><br>
    If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here for thirty (30) days so that you will
    always know what information we have gathered, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it
    to
    anyone.</p>
  <p><strong>Removing Your Information from Our Records</strong><br>
    If for some reason, you want us to remove your credit card and contact information from our database, we will --
    after all of your transactions have been completed. All you have to do is send us an email at
    <a href="mailto:info@uwbookstore.com">info@uwbookstore.com</a>.
    Such information, however, is never completely removed from our database archives because we routinely back up
    our
    servers for disaster recovery and tax-record purposes.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Disclosures Required Under Law</strong><br>
    The University Book Store will disclose personal information or information collected about your use of the site
    in
    response to valid requests by legal authorities or in order to comply with the legal process.
