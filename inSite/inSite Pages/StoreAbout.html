    Celebrates 130 Years of
    Serving the University of Wisconsin – Madison and&nbsp;Surrounding&nbsp;Communities</h1>

  <p>Since 1894, the University Book Store has been a cornerstone of academic and community support for the <a
      href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">University
      of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison</a> and the surrounding area. This year, the beloved institution marks a significant
    milestone as it celebrates 130 years of continuous operation, providing resources and experiences that have enriched
    the lives of students, <a href="https://www.uwalumni.com/">Alumni</a>, and Badger fans alike.</p>

  <p>The University Book Store was established to benefit the student body and has remained steadfast in that goal.
    Through its comprehensive range of services and products, the store has been an integral part of each student&apos;s
    academic journey, a reliable partner for all things collegiate, and a resource for even the most discerning Badger
    fan. With no external aid or funding, the University Book Store&apos;s commitment to its patrons &ndash; past,
    present, and future &ndash; remains unrivaled.</p>

  <p>&quot;We are profoundly honored to have served as the University&apos;s companion in education and the
    community&apos;s provider of Wisconsin apparel and gifts, along with books and scholarly supplies for well over a
    century,&quot; said University Book Store President Kevin Phelps. &quot;Reaching this milestone is a testament to
    our customers&apos; loyalty and our staff&rsquo;s dedicated service through the years.&quot;</p>

  <p>To celebrate this landmark occasion, the University Book Store will host a series of events and promotions
    throughout the year, with a special tribute to its rich history and a focus on the next chapter. </p>

  <p>The kick-off event will be held on Feb. 26, the official &quot;birthday.&quot; Students, alums, and all fans are
    invited to visit our four locations and enjoy prizes, giveaways, free food, and the biggest sale in the Book
    Store&apos;s history.</p>

  <p>As a non-stockholding corporation, the University Book Store takes great pride in reinvesting its proceeds into
    local communities and enhancing student life. Each purchase directly supports various initiatives that aim to make
    academic resources and experiences more accessible and enriching.</p>

  <p>The University Book Store is not just a retail destination; it&apos;s a vital part of the educational ecosystem
    that fosters a love for learning and community spirit. The 130th anniversary is a time to reflect on the past, look
    forward, and continue the journey of learning and growth.</p>
