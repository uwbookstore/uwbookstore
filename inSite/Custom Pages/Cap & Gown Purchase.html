    Since the University of Wisconsin
    awarded its first doctoral degree to Charles Van Hise in -->


<!-- eighteen hundred and ninety two -->


<!-- 1892, we have used The Classic black doctoral gown for our degree
    candidates and doctoral faculty members. That doctoral gown is black with velvet chevrons on the sleeves and
    velvet panels on the front. The color of the velvet chevrons and panels may be black (and worn with any doctoral
    hood) or may represent a particular degree (and match the velvet trim of the hood) according to the appropriate
    color signifying a particular field of study: forest green (MD), apricot (DNP), purple (JD), sapphire blue
    (Ph.D.), gray (D.V.M.), pink (D.Mus.A), olive green (D.Pharm.), spruce green (DAud), green (DPT), or brown
    (MFA). The doctoral hood is black with cardinal red lining (representing the University of Wisconsin-Madison)
    and the velvet trim of the appropriate academic color.
