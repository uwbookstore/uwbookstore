  <h1 class="heading__line">Our Models</h1>
  <p>We have chosen to represent our Badger gear in the best way possible, on real Badger fans! All our clothing
    models
    are members of our community, either customers, employees, or current students at the University of
    Wisconsin-Madison.</p>

      <h2 class="heading__small">Model of the Month</h2>
      <p>Our biggest modeling initiative is the Model of the Month program. We began the program in 2012, offering
        an
        opportunity for the students of the University of Wisconsin-Madison to represent their campus. Twelve
        students,
        one for every month, are chosen yearly through an application and interview process. These are the very
        models
        you see throughout our website!</p>
      <p>The student models are enthusiastic and we are happy to provide this fun and different experience. Each
        model
        brings their unique personality to this campus, our clothing, and the community. We work with the models
        and
        give back to a charity of their choice as a thank you for the work they share with us. Please click <a

        the
        charitable organizations we have worked with. Visit us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uwbookstore"
