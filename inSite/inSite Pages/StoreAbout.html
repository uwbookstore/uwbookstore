      Celebrates 130 Years of Serving the University of Wisconsin – Madison and&nbsp;Surrounding&nbsp;Communities</h1>

    <p>Since 1894, the University Book Store has been a cornerstone of academic and community support for the <a
        href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a> and the surrounding area. This
      year, the beloved institution marks a significant milestone as it celebrates 130 years of continuous operation,
      providing resources and experiences that have enriched the lives of students, <a
        href="https://www.uwalumni.com/">Alumni</a>, and Badger fans alike.</p>

    <p>The University Book Store was established to benefit the student body and has remained steadfast in that goal.
      Through
      its comprehensive range of services and products, the store has been an integral part of each student's academic
      journey, a reliable partner for all things collegiate, and a resource for even the most discerning Badger fan.
      With
      no
      external aid or funding, the University Book Store's commitment to its patrons – past, present, and future –
      remains
      unrivaled.</p>

    <p>&quot;We are profoundly honored to have served as the University&apos;s companion in education and the
      community&apos;s provider of
      Wisconsin apparel and gifts, along with books and scholarly supplies for well over a century,&quot; said
      University
      Book
      Store President Kevin Phelps. &quot;Reaching this milestone is a testament to our customers&apos; loyalty and our
      staff&rsquo;s
      dedicated service through the years.&quot;</p>

    <!-- <div class="hilight-qt">
      <p>To celebrate this landmark occasion, the University Book Store will host a series of events and promotions
        throughout the year, with a special tribute to its rich history and a focus on the next chapter.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.uwbookstore.com/Giveaway">kick-off event</a> will be held on Feb. 26, the official
        "birthday." Students, alums, and all fans are invited to visit our four locations and enjoy prizes, giveaways,
        free food, and the <a href="https://www.uwbookstore.com/Giveaway">biggest sale</a> in the Book Store's history.

      resources and experiences more accessible and enriching.</p>

    <p>The University Book Store is not just a retail destination; it's a vital part of the educational ecosystem that
      fosters
